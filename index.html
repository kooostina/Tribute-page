     <h2>Here are some of the highlights of his career:</h2>
     <ul>
       <li>After completing his degree in Natural Sciences at Cambridge University Sir David’s first job was in the Navy for two years from 1947.</li>
       <li>When Sir David accepted the offer of his first job at the BBC in 1952 he like most Britons, didn’t own a television and had only ever watched one TV programme.</li>
       <li>He was Controller of BBC2 (1965-68), during which time he introduced colour television to Britain and commissioned an eclectic mix of programming, including Monty Python.</li>
       <li>Sir David Attenborough is believed to be one of the most travelled men in history. In order to film the Life of Birds series he had to travel over 256,000 miles. This is equivalent to going around the world 10 times!</li>
       <li>In 1985 Sir David received his knighthood. He was previously honoured with a CBE (Commander of the British Empire) in 1974.</li>
       <li>Sir David is the only person to have won a BAFTA in black and white, colour, HD and 3D.</li>
       <li>His latest work is the film <q>A life on our planet</q> which acts as a <q>witness statement</q>, through which Attenborough shares first-hand his concern for the current state of the planet due to humanity's impact on nature and his hopes for the future. It was released on Netflix on 4 October 2020, along with a companion book A Life on Our Planet.</li>
